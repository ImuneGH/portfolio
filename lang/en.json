I have taken most of the courses online as a self-taught so far (without a lecturer). However, I have just finished the JS Academy course from Skillmea (with a lecturer) and I still have the final exam to do.",

This website is my very first project, on which I would like to learn to apply all the experience and knowledge I have gathered in the courses mentioned above. I would like to do another project in some JS framework in the near future (Probably Vue or React)."
