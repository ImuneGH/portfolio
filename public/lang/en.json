      "Hello, my name is Martin and I am an IT enthusiast with a focus on frontend development.I have completed several online courses covering HTML, CSS, responsive design, Git, JavaScript, React, and other technologies. I have studied most of the courses on my own (without a lecturer). However, I have completed the JS Academy course from Skillmea (with a lecturer) as well, finished by passing the final exam.",
      "I also have experience with the backend language Node.js and its framework Express, the SQLite database, and the Electron.js framework, which I used in one of my largest projects so far, FlavorLog (see the <a class='flavor-log-link' href='#flavor-log'>Projects</a> section). In my recent projects, I also worked with TypeScript and React Routes.",
      "I am currently focused on maintaining and expanding my existing projects and starting to work on a team game project called Color Recall.",
