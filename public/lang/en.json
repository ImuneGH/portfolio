I have completed several HTML, CSS, responsive design, GIT, JavaScript, React and a few other online courses. I have taken most of the courses as a self-taught(without a lecturer). However, I have done the JS Academy course from Skillmea (with a lecturer) as well, finished by passing the final exam.",
